# CS113
Our game will be an educational side-scrolling game where the objective is to collect resources to perform various science based tasks in order to progress through the levels.

# Meeting times
Tuesdays and Thursdays before class at 6:30, expect meetings to be 30 minutes to an hour. Essentially we will use this time to create issues in github and keep everyone on track.
